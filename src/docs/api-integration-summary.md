# America's Pharmacy API Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to integrate the America's Pharmacy API into our FrugalRx application. The integration allows us to provide real-time medication pricing and pharmacy information to our users.

## Implemented Endpoints

We have successfully implemented the following API endpoints:

1. **Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 token endpoint with client credentials flow
   - Token caching and automatic refresh

2. **Drug Search**
   - POST `/v1/drugs/names` - Search for drugs by name prefix
   - GET `/v1/drugs/{prefixText}` - Alternative method for drug search

3. **Drug Pricing**
   - POST `/v1/drugprices/byName` - Get prices for a medication by name
   - POST `/v1/drugprices/byGSN` - Get prices for a medication by GSN
   - POST `/v1/drugprices/byNdcCode` - Get prices for a medication by NDC code

4. **Drug Information**
   - GET `/v1/druginfo/{gsn}` - Get detailed information about a medication

5. **Pharmacy Information**
   - GET `/v1/pharmacies` - Get pharmacies near a location

## API Testing

We've created comprehensive testing tools:

1. **Test Script**: `src/scripts/test-api-connection.js`
   - Tests authentication
   - Tests drug search (POST and GET methods)
   - Tests drug prices API
   - Tests group drug prices API (found to be unavailable)

2. **API Test Page**: `/api-test`
   - Web interface for testing API endpoints
   - Shows connection status
   - Allows testing drug search with both methods

## Implementation Notes

1. **Minimum Character Requirement**
   - All drug search endpoints require at least 3 characters
   - This validation is implemented on both client and server sides

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling for API failures
   - Option to fall back to mock data when API fails

3. **Authentication**
   - Token caching to minimize authentication requests
   - Automatic token refresh when expired

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Flexible configuration via environment variables
   - Support for mock data in development

## Unavailable Endpoints

During testing, we discovered that some documented endpoints are not actually available:

1. **Group Drug Prices**
   - `POST /v1/drugprices/groupdrugprices` returns 404 Not Found

2. **Multi-Drug Pricing**
   - These endpoints have not been tested yet

## Next Steps

1. **Test Multi-Drug Pricing Endpoints**
   - Implement and test the multi-drug pricing endpoints if needed

2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages and fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize API requests to minimize latency

4. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Enhance the medication search experience
   - Improve pharmacy price comparison display
