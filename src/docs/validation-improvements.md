# API Validation Improvements

This document summarizes the validation improvements made to the America's Pharmacy API integration in the FrugalRx application.

## Overview

We've implemented comprehensive validation for drug name searches across all API endpoints to ensure that:

1. All drug name searches require a minimum of 3 characters
2. Validation is consistent across all layers of the application
3. Appropriate error messages are returned to users
4. The application gracefully handles validation errors

## Implemented Changes

### Server-Side Validation

1. **medicationService.ts**
   - Updated `getDrugInfoByName()` to validate drug name length and format
   - Updated `searchDrugs()` to enforce minimum character requirement
   - Updated `getDrugPrices()` to normalize and validate drug names

### API Route Validation

1. **Drug Info API**
   - Updated `src/app/api/drugs/info/name/route.ts` to check for minimum character length
   - Added clear error messages for invalid drug names

2. **Drug Prices API**
   - Updated `src/app/api/drugs/prices/route.ts` to validate drug name length
   - Added validation for both POST and GET methods
   - Improved error handling with descriptive messages

3. **Drug Search API**
   - Ensured consistent validation across all search endpoints
   - Added proper error responses for invalid search queries

### Client-Side Validation

1. **MedicationSearch Component**
   - Updated to require minimum 3 characters for search
   - Added user feedback for short search queries

2. **API Test Page**
   - Updated to validate input length before submitting requests
   - Added error display for validation failures

### Testing

1. **Test Script**
   - Updated `src/scripts/test-api-connection.js` to test validation
   - Added specific tests for short drug name validation
   - Improved error handling and reporting

## Benefits

These improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Better User Experience**: Users receive clear feedback when their search queries are too short
2. **Reduced API Errors**: Prevents unnecessary API calls with invalid parameters
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Ensures consistent validation across all parts of the application
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages instead of generic failures
5. **API Compliance**: Ensures compliance with America's Pharmacy API requirements

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more sophisticated validation for drug names (e.g., checking for special characters)
2. Implement client-side caching to reduce API calls for common searches
3. Add fuzzy matching for drug names to improve search results
